## Arctic SDI embedded map examples

This page features some examples of Arctic SDI embedded maps, made in a [Geoportal](https://geoportal.arctic-sdi.org/) powered by Oskari.

[The Arctic SDI](https://arctic-sdi.org/) – is a collaborative partner-based effort by the National Mapping Agencies of the eight
Arctic Countries – facilitating the development of an Arctic Spatial Data Infrastructure and providing
tools for data distributors to ensure that geospatial data is easier for users to access, validate and
combine with other data.
